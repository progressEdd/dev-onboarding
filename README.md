# dev-env
## Background
Welcome to this repository! I created this repo initially to recall how I configured my own development environment. As I onboard junior developers to python llm projects, I realized that the pages I created would also be helpful to refer people to. The intended audience has a beginner to intermediate python development experience.

Feel free to report any issues on the [issues tab](https://github.com/progressEdd/dev-env/issues)
